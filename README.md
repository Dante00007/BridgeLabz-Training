<h3><b>Day 02</b></h3><br>
Date: 19/12/2025
Topics: Architecture, Access Modifiers,C# Operators,C# Datatypes, Entry Point Of C#/.net, Features of C#

What I Learned

Architecture: .net uses two compilers Msil and CLR. How It Integrates with other languages.
Access Modifiers: public,private,protected,internal.
C# Operators: Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,++),Relational operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,!),Logical operators(&&,||,!)
Datatypes: Difference between Primitive and Non Primitive datatypes.
Entry point of c#: Main method is the entry point of a program in C#. It is called by the runtime environment when the application starts executing.
Features of C#: Object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, objects, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation etc.

Task for the Day:
1.Use all the primitive datatypes and store them in a csharp script and pust it onto github.
2.Use all the operators and store them in a csharp script and push it onto github.

What's Next
C# Programming Elements Level-01. lab assignment will be solved.
