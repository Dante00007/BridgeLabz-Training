<h2><b>Day 02</b></h3><br>
Date: 19/12/2025<br>
Topics: Architecture, Access Modifiers,C# Operators,C# Datatypes, Entry Point Of C#/.net, Features of C#<br>

<h3>What I Learned</h3>
Architecture: .net uses two compilers Msil and CLR. How It Integrates with other languages.<br>
Access Modifiers: public,private,protected,internal.<br>
C# Operators: Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,++),Relational operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,!),Logical operators(&&,||,!)<br>
Datatypes: Difference between Primitive and Non Primitive datatypes.<br>
Entry point of c#: Main method is the entry point of a program in C#. It is called by the runtime environment when the application starts executing.<br>
Features of C#: Object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, objects, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation etc.<br>

<h3>Task for the Day:</h3>
1.Use all the primitive datatypes and store them in a csharp script and pust it onto github.<br>
2.Use all the operators and store them in a csharp script and push it onto github.<br>

<h3>What's Next</h3>
