What I Learned<br>

Architecture: .net uses two compilers Msil and CLR. How It Integrates with other languages.<br>
Access Modifiers: public,private,protected,internal.<br>
C# Operators: Arithmetic operators(+,-,*,/,%,++),Relational operators(>,<,>=,<=,==,!),Logical operators(&&,||,!)<br>
Datatypes: Difference between Primitive and Non Primitive datatypes.<br>
Entry point of c#: Main method is the entry point of a program in C#. It is called by the runtime environment when the application starts executing.<br>
Features of C#: Object-oriented programming (OOP) features like classes, objects, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation etc.<br>

Task for the Day:<br>
1.Use all the primitive datatypes and store them in a csharp script and pust it onto github.<br>
2.Use all the operators and store them in a csharp script and push it onto github.<br>

What's Next<br>
C# Programming Elements Level-01. lab assignment will be solved.<br>
